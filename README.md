# Python Scientific Calculator (Tkinter)

This project implements a **graphical scientific calculator** using **Python** and **Tkinter**, supporting both basic arithmetic and advanced mathematical operations. The calculator features a clean GUI, keyboard input support, and a secure expression evaluation mechanism.

## Features

- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** Built with Tkinter for a lightweight and responsive desktop application  
- **Basic Arithmetic Operations:**  
  Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, parentheses  
- **Scientific Functions:**  
  - Square root (`√`)  
  - Power operations (`x²`, `x^y`)  
  - Trigonometric functions: `sin`, `cos`, `tan`, `cot` (degree-based)  
  - Logarithmic function (`log₁₀`)  
- **Constants Support:**  
  - π (`pi`)  
  - Euler’s number (`e`)  
- **Keyboard Bindings:**  
  Full keyboard input support for numbers, operators, and function shortcuts  
- **Safe Expression Evaluation:**  
  Uses a restricted `eval` environment to prevent unsafe code execution  
- **Error Handling:**  
  Gracefully handles invalid expressions and mathematical errors  
- **Auto Parenthesis Completion:**  
  Automatically closes unbalanced parentheses before evaluation

## Academic Purpose

This project demonstrates practical concepts in:

- **Python GUI programming** using Tkinter  
- **Event-driven programming**  
- **Secure expression evaluation**  
- **Mathematical function handling**  
- **User input validation and error handling**

It is suitable as a **computer workshop**, **introductory software engineering**, or **Python programming** course project.
